## Reflection

This was a 3 day long project built during learning react. Project goals included using technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing myself with documentation for new features.

This is just a side project to grasp knowledge over react, javascript and CSS

One of the main challenges I ran into was Designing.This leads me to spend 6-7 hours on a research spike into modern CSS

 I chose to use the `create-react-app` boilerplate to minimize initial setup and invest more time in diving into weird technological rabbit holes. In the next iteration I plan on handrolling a `webpack.config.js` file to more fully understand the build process.
